      <section class="about" id="about">
        <p>
          Imminence began with a passion for metal music between vocalist and
          violinist Eddie Berg and guitarist Harald Barrett when they were just
          teenagers in High School. Back in 2010 our biggest dream was just to
          play our music live. With countless of hours in the local community
          rehearsal basement, we took one step at a time, always reaching for
          new heights. Right from the start we knew that this was what we wanted
          to do. All our hard-earned money went into taking that next step;
          recording in a studio; getting new equipment; making music videos;
          printing CDs. The list goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was never any doubt or obstacle that would stop us in our
          tracks. We produced our own music videos, booked our own tours,
          founded our own company and sacrificed everything to make this work.
          From the beginning there was an unyielding dedication to write music
          that was meaningful to us, and when we started to see that people out
          in the world resonated with our songs and lyrics, this feeling
          increased tenfold. It wasn't just about us anymore, we had something
          to say and there was someone listening.

          It's hard to grasp the impact that Imminence has had on our lives and
          so many others, but through you we have a better understanding. You
          give us purpose. You give our music purpose.

          When we started our own webstore, we wanted to take full control over
          the products that we develop as a band. Our love for our craft should
          translate in every single thing that we do. That's why we only use
          high quality materials that are environmentally friendly, fair trade
          and vegan.
